          when google search engine looks for menu, it searches <nav> tag
          <head> will not display on webpage but can be seen as abstract of a thesis
          <head> contains <meta> (the keywords of the website) and <title>
          <title> should contain the value of <h1>
          one page can only have single <h1>
          The Body of the thesis is <h1>
          <h1> name is very important should close to search keyword
          <h2> is the supporting points
          <h3> supports <h2>
          Do not use <div> to contain text, should use <p>
          In the DOM tree, primarily we use <p> to explain the <h1>
          <Span>: cannot exit independently (Should be placed in <p> or <div>)
          Ranking score has nothing to do with the amount of clicking, but content score and link score (Ranking score =  content score * link score)
          How to increase link score
          Contact authority to publish our webpage or "partnership link"  or publish in social media platform
          Image size in mobile phone should not exceeds viewport of mobile phone
          Buy expiring domain with high authority and add my website link onto the bought one?
          Site structure should not change after deployment on google
          When design the website, the structure of website url should be consistent
          Site structure should be semantic! and be logical!
          If DOM is too deep too long too much, not good to SEO (less than 1000 DOM nodes)
          Reuse code to reduce nodes
          Do not use duplicate content because google do not know which one rank first
          Use canonical tag to reduce the duplication
          Site Structure: DOM authority (under domain) and Page authority (each page's authority is independent)
          To Google, it will treat the parameter as different page eg: www.company.com/?params=sth
          We use <link rel="canonical" href=""> to solve this problem
          <head> no chinese spelling comma,
          <Img alt> cannot be empty, it should describe
          Use responsive design instead of m. Site
          Internal links is important for seo
          Internal links only use <a> and show <a title> do not use button
